4. Authentication:

- Firebase Authentication: For handling user authentication.

5. Forms:

- Formik: A form library for React to handle form state and validation.

6. HTTP Requests:

- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making requests.

7. Routing:

- Next.js Route: Integrated routing capabilities in Next.js.

8. Deployment:

- Vercel or Netlify: Platforms for deploying and hosting Next.js applications.

## Backend (Server-side):

1. Serverless Functions (Optional):

- Vercel Serverless Functions or Netlify Functions: For serverless backend functionality.

2. Database:

- Firebase Firestore: A NoSQL cloud database for storing application data.

3. Authentication (Server-side):

- Firebase Authentication: To verify user identify on the server side.

4. APIs (Optional):

3. Package Manager:

- npm: Node Package Manager for managing project dependencies.

4. Design Tools (Optional):

- Figma or Adobe XD: For designing and prototyping.

5. Testing (Optional):

- Jest and React Testing Library: For testing React components.

## DevOps:
